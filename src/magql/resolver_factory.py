    The super class for all builtin CRUD magql resolvers. Establishes
    the call order of the resolve functions. Resolve is broken down into
    3 main sections, :func:`pre-resolve`, :func:`resolve`, and
    :func:`post-resolve`. :func:`re-resolve` allows modification of the
    arguments that will be passed to :func:`resolve`. :func:`resolve`
    is broken down into 4 sections, :func:`retrieve_value`, :func:`authorize`,
    :func:`validate`, and :func:`mutate`. :func:`resolve` returns a value
    that can be modified by :func:`post_resolve`, which can perform side
    effects such as commiting the session. The order of these functions
    is the suggested way of organizing the resolve order such that overriding
    and/or extending the functionality is easiest.
